                            relevance. The importance of Educational trips include giving students a chance to build closer bonds with their
                            classmates, experience of new environment and enjoy a day away from the school premises and learning at the same time,
                            being independent and self reliant.
                            We believe in providing the same to our students. We believe that getting away from everyday atmosphere of the classroom
                            gives students an opportunity to spend time with each other in a new environment.
